# Repo for the git-immersion excercise

### General instructions (read this, before you begin): 

1. Red **<font color="red">Note</font>** messages at different steps are enphasising special instructions or trap places.
1. The .rb files in the tutorial are Ruby code files, the exact content and logic is usually not the focus here.
1. Some commands apearing in the tutorial are unix shell command (rather than git), if you work in a Windows shell you might need to find the equivalent (e.g. steps 11, 21-22). We recommend working with a git aware shell (like the Git Shell installed by GithubDesktop on Windows).
1. At each stage you can save your work to github by following the last lab step (53): pushing to your github account, and then continue elsewhere by cloning or pulling.
1. Finally (step 53) [push][ref-push] all your commits, branches and tags.
1. If you want a local version of this tutorial, you can optionaly [clone][ref-clone] or download this repository to your local machine and open ./html/index.html (if you cloned it, remove the .git folder before you begin).
1. If you have an improvement suggestion or a bug fix for this tutorial, please open an [issue](./issues) here or send a PR with a fix.

### Follow these steps:
- Install a git client (already exists on Lab machines)
- Clone your copy of this repository to your machine (e.g., with the green 'clone' button above)
- Follow the online [tutoiral](http://jce-il.github.io/git-immersion/html/) (or the local version inside: ./html/index.html), by clicking the green arrow (quite a lot of the 53 steps are actually skipped, see inside).

Good luck!
